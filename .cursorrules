# General

- Routes go in routes/ directory - use _app.tsx for root layout and _404.tsx for not found page
- Interactive components (with client-side JS) go in islands/ directory, static components in components/
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props (e.g., interface IButtonProps)
- Follow Fresh.js conventions: handlers.ts for API routes, page components as default exports
- Use Tailwind utility classes directly in components, customize in tailwind.config.ts
- PascalCase for component names (Button.tsx), kebab-case for routes (blog-post.tsx)
- Import Fresh modules using $fresh/ prefix, follow import map in deno.json
- Keep components pure and functional, use Preact signals for state management
- Place API routes in routes/api/ directory with .ts extension
- Follow Deno's built-in formatter rules (deno fmt) and linting rules (deno lint)
- Use globalThis instead of window

# Design style

- black, minimalistic Vercel/ShadCN style design
- dark mode by default, light switch provided
- no scroll, everything should fit on one screen
