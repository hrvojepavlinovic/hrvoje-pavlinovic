      and playgrnd in this repo with findings, remove data that doesn't align
- [ ] Remove conact page since we have contact links on frontpage
- [ ] Update the overall tone and content of frontpage and other pages, you can
      keep cv part untouched because it needs separate review. Here is detailed
      description:

Please act as an expert technical copywriter and senior web developer. I need to
update the content and tone of my personal portfolio website
(hrvoje.pavlinovic.com) to reflect a more authoritative, high-signal "Senior
Backend Engineer" persona. The tone should be concise, professional, and
confident—focusing on scale, stability, and my core life pillars (Family,
Software, Fitness).

Please generate the updated HTML/React components or plain text for the
following routes based on these exact instructions:

- frontpage

Keep the main headline: "Senior backend engineer scaling interactive commerce at
Tilt."

Add a high-impact subheadline (Hero section): Immediately below the main
headline, add the most impressive statistic from my current about page: "12+
years of experience. Scaled systems past 1.7B requests per month." This needs to
be visually prominent (bolded or larger font).

Keep the tech flex: Ensure the "Built with Fresh" footer or badge remains
visible.

- /about

Remove casual/self-deprecating humor: Completely delete the joke about exploring
new ideas "usually when I'm in bathroom," the line about "stealing candies from
my kids," and the apology about my bad knees ("don't hate pls"). Delete the word
"Wannabe" from "Wannabe fit dad."

Rewrite the Intro (Professional): Structure the first paragraph to highlight my
expertise. Use this draft as a baseline: "I specialize in building performant
software and making complex systems simple. With over 12 years of experience
across Web3, automotive, health care, media, and commerce, I focus on stability,
scale, and speed. Currently, I am heading the backend infrastructure at Tilt."

Rewrite the Personal section (Lifestyle & Pillars): Frame my hobbies as
high-performance lifestyle choices. Draft: "Outside of the terminal, my life
revolves around family, health, and sound money. I am a proud father of two, an
active fitness enthusiast (football, padel, gym, cycling), and a firm believer
that Bitcoin can change the world for the better."

Refine the Goals/Future section: Keep the ambition but make it sound sharp.
Draft: "I remain curious and focused on the future. My current goals are
achieving absolute financial independence, building impactful personal products,
and traveling the world with my wife and kids."

- /projects

Standardize descriptions: Update the copy for my active projects to be
action-oriented and clean, matching my X (Twitter) profile:

Memoato: "A quantified self & journaling application designed for peak
performance and life tracking."

PLAYGRND: "A social platform dedicated to organizing local football matches and
bringing the game back to the people."

XXI Today: "A Bitcoin wallet and .btc domain explorer, integrated seamlessly
with the XVerse wallet."
