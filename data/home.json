    "Wannabe fit dad of 2 and a husband to a beautiful wife. I am passionate about programming, which is quite neat considering I do that for a living. As you can imagine, my schedule is quite busy, but I love every second of it.",
    "Quick workout sessions, occasional football game, and recently padel (don't hate pls, my knees can't put up with football anymore) keep my head clear and stop my body from gaining too much weight (because I'm stealing candies from my kids, for their own good).",
    "I like building performant software and making complex things simple, currently looking after Tilt's backend by day and exploring new ideas and concepts once the house is quiet (or usually when I'm in bathroom).",
    "12+ years in the business, paved my way through thick and thin by working in web3, automotive, health care, commerce, media, and whatnot industries.",
    "When it comes to numbers, I managed to scale systems past 1.7B requests per month. Still curious, still learning, grateful and excited for the future."
